Hi! I'm Pablo, physicist and deep learning scientist. I completed my **PhD in Physics** at the University of València and Instituto de Física Corpuscular, investigating the nature of **dark matter** through **cosmology**, specially via the 21 cm cosmological signal of the hydrogen. **mention pbhs**

I have applied **deep learning** techniques to cosmology, such as **convolutional neural networks** and **graph neural networks**. For instance, in [this work](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.14874) I have trained a model to weigh the masses of our galaxy and its neighbor Andromeda, being the first time that artificial intelligence is applied to this task. I'm also member of the [CAMELS collaboration](https://www.camel-simulations.org/), a project to produce cosmological simulations specially designed for machine learning applications.

I recently joined the Computer Vision Center at the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona as a **deep learning scientist**. There, I am applying graph neural networks in to learn terramechanics simulations in the autonomous driving project [CARLA](https://carla.org/).

I have led several projects with international collaborators, written **17 scientific articles** and given talks at the universities of Princeton, Tokyo, Nagoya and Brussels. You can see below one of my recent talks on deep learning applications in cosmology.
