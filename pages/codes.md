These are some of the codes I used in my research on 21 cm cosmology and machine learning.

- [21cmDeepLearning](https://github.com/PabloVD/21cmDeepLearning)

Convolutional Neural Network to extract the underlying matter density field from a 21 cm map, employing the U-Net architecture in Pytorch. More details in the paper [2006.14305](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.14305)

- [DCGAN](https://github.com/PabloVD/ImageGAN)

Implementation of a DCGAN in Tensorflow for generating pictures.

- [21cmSolver](https://github.com/PabloVD/21cmSolver)

Python code to compute the thermal evolution of the universe and to compute the 21 cm global signal, taking into account the over densities. More details in the paper [arXiv:1912.09488](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.09488), [Phys. Rev. D 101, 083502](https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.101.083502).

Take a look [here](https://github.com/PabloVD) at all my public codes in GitHub.
