Hi! I'm Pablo, a PhD student on physics at the University of València and Instituto de Física Corpuscular. In my research, I mostly focus on investigating the nature of dark matter through cosmology, specially via the 21 cm cosmological signal of the hydrogen. Moreover, I have applied deep learning techniques to cosmology, such as convolutional neural networks and graph neural networks. I'm interested in data science and machine learning applied to industry.

I have given talks at the universities of Princeton, Tokyo and Brussels.
