Hi! I'm Pablo, currently a research assistant at the University of València and Instituto de Física Corpuscular, where I recently obtained my **PhD in Physics**. In my research, I have mostly focused on investigating the nature of **dark matter** through **cosmology**, specially via the 21 cm cosmological signal of the hydrogen.

Moreover, I have applied **deep learning** techniques to cosmology, such as **convolutional neural networks** and **graph neural networks**. I have experience with mathematical modeling, data analysis and programming. After completing my PhD, I'm now interested in **data science** and machine learning applied to industry.

I have led several projects with international collaborators, written **14 scientific articles** and given talks at the universities of Princeton, Tokyo, Nagoya and Brussels.
